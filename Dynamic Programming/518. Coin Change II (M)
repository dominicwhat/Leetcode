# dp = [[0 if i!=0 else 1 for j in range(len(coins) + 1)] for i in range(amount+1)]
# dp[i][j], where i represents the amount, and j represents whether the first j coins are included or not, signifies the minimum number of coins from the set 1 to j required to reach the amount i.
# Initialize dp. If amount = 0, then set dp[0][j] = 1. Conversely, if coin = 0, then set dp[i][j] = 0.
# The inner list represents columns, while the outer list represents rows.

# For the j-th coin, we consider its value as coins[j-1] rather than coins[j].

# State transition equation: 
# dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-coins[j-1]][j], i-coins[j-1] >= 0
# dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1], o.w.
